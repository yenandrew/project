## Issue I faced when working on this project

- Working with Flask Authentication is looks really hard because handling the user state looks really hard in start but As I did some progress things seems very clear to me.
- Working with Flask SQL ALCHEMY is really hard especially when do some changes in the table and it didn't reflect but after do some R&D on it become very easy to work.
